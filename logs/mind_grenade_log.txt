                        Development Log

2019 December 2

Began development of version 1.1.

Added a "set tune n" command to select one of 15 different
mappings from the four bits of the shift registers used to
determine the tone to the index of clips at various frequencies.
This works exactly like the four switches on the original
hardware Mind Grenade.  Set n between 0 and 5 to choose the
tune.

Added display of the tune to the "status" command.

Added display of free and used script memory to the "status"
command.

Implemented logic in the touch_start() event handler to
transform the location of the touch into the local co-ordinate
system of the main panel, then test whether the user touched in
the bottom 38%.  If so, the touch does not toggle the play/stop
mode, but rather flips a bit of the tune selection register,
with the bit depending on which lateral quarter of the band at
the bottom was touched, from left to right: 8, 4, 2, 1.

Added four new button/lights, named "L1", "L2", "L4", and "L8",
which show the states of the corresponding bits in the
tuneSelect register (grey for zero, pale green for one) and,
which clicked in the general vicinity toggle those bits.
Display of the state of tuneSelect on these light is done by
updateLights(), which is called at state_entry() and whenever
tuneSelect changes.

Prepared a YouTube video demonstration.  The video is produced
in:
    ~/w/Mind_Grenade/movies
from OpenShot project file:
    Mind_Grenade_SL.osp
and yielding:
    Mind_grenade_SL.mp4
a 194 megabyte (!) file suitable for uploading.  The file was
uploaded to YouTube as:
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5sOpLgJkZQ
    
Created local development Git repository in:
    ~/w/SecondLife/MindGrenade/git
with:
    git init

Added and committed:
    Special files (README.md, etc.)
    Textures
    Notecards (User Guide / Help file)
    Marketplace (listing text, images)
    Scripts
    Logs (this file)


Logged on to github.com.

Created a new repository:
    mind_grenade
with access URLs:
    HTTPS: https://github.com/Fourmilab/mind_grenade.git
    SSH:   git@github.com:Fourmilab/mind_grenade.git

Pushed the production directory to the repository with:
    git remote add origin git@github.com:Fourmilab/mind_grenade.git
    git push -u origin master

Confirmed that my local "git sync" command works with the remote
repository.

Added an llResetScript() call to the on_rez() event.  This
guarantees that all script variables are reset to their defaults
when the object is instantiated from the inventory, not left at
whatever values they had when taken into inventory.
